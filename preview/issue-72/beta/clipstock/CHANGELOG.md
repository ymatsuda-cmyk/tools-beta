## 1.8.0 - 2026-09-12

### Title

Rate the ideas yourself, one by one or in bulk

### Changes

- Stopped asking the model for a rank on 応用 and 活用. Every generated idea now starts at zero stars, so the ordering reflects your own reading rather than the model's self-assessment.
- Added multi-select to the idea feed with a bulk star action in the toolbar. Setting or clearing stars applies to every selected idea at once.
- Added drag-to-select over the cards. The rubber band only starts after the pointer travels 5px, so a plain click still opens a card, and Shift/Ctrl while releasing adds to the current selection instead of replacing it.
- Grouped the bulk write by video and kind before saving. 応用 and 活用 each pack several ideas into one text property, so saving per idea would overwrite the previous write and lose the earlier stars.
- Rolled back the stars of any group whose save failed and reported it, leaving the groups that succeeded untouched.
- Asked for the list JSON rebuild right away after a star change instead of letting it sit in the 30s/5min throttle. The feed is drawn from `idea-*.json`, so without it the new order only appeared after the next unrelated save.
- Put a cursor on the mindmap. It starts on the centre node, moves with the arrow keys, and Space edits the branch in place by turning markmap's own label element into a contenteditable seeded with the raw Markdown text (so markers and timecodes are not swallowed into the label). Tab adds a child, Enter adds a sibling, and the edit is written back into the Markdown and saved.
- Fed the edited Markdown back through `setData` instead of rebuilding the map, so only the new branch animates in and the zoom and pan stay put. Folds are carried over by hand because `setData` would otherwise re-apply `initialExpandLevel` and close everything the reader had opened.
- Moved the whole mindmap engine into `api/mindmap2` and left only the video-specific decoration here (playback links and markers), which it now passes in as hooks. The議事録 app draws from the same file, so the two cannot drift apart again.

## 1.7.0 - 2026-09-11

### Title

Mark up mindmap branches, and collect the published ones into their own tab

### Changes

- Added markers to the mindmap. markmap draws into SVG, so the drag-to-select flow used by the text tabs does not apply; instead you pick a colour in the footer and click a branch. The colour is stored as the same `<m1>…</m1>` wrapper the other fields use — embedded in the branch's own line — so editing the Markdown later cannot shift a marker onto the wrong branch, and `plainTextOf` keeps stripping it everywhere else.
- Located the clicked branch by walking the markmap tree in pre-order and pairing it with the non-blank lines of the Markdown. The generator emits exactly one node per line, so the two orders match without depending on markmap's internal payload.
- Painted the clicked branch directly in the DOM instead of re-rendering. `Markmap.create` refits the view, which would throw away the reader's zoom and pan on every click.
- Added a 公開 checkbox column in Notion and a toggle on the mindmap tab, plus a third view tab that lists the published mindmaps. The cards only carry the thumbnail and title; the map itself is fetched and drawn when a card is opened, so the tab stays cheap no matter how many are published.
- Gave each idea its own publish switch, defaulting to on. A Notion column cannot hold a per-idea flag — 応用 and 活用 each pack several ideas into one text property — so the state lives in the idea's own heading as a leading `[非公開]`. Storing an index instead would break the moment a regeneration reorders them.
- Put a hide switch on each card in the idea feed and the mindmap tab, so something can be dropped from the published view where you noticed it. The detail tabs keep the full toggle, which is the only way back once an item is hidden from the list. Hiding from the feed matches on the heading rather than the index, because the feed is built from a JSON snapshot that can lag behind Notion.

## 1.6.1 - 2026-09-11

### Title

Split the list and idea JSON per source and route writes to the right Notion

### Changes

- Split `index.json` / `ideas.json` into `index-video.json` + `index-web.json` and `idea-video.json` + `idea-web.json`. The two halves come from different Notion databases refreshed by different jobs, so keeping them in one file meant a failure on either side rewrote — or stalled — the whole list. `src/lib/store.js` reads both halves and merges them by key; if one is missing the other still shows. When neither exists it falls back to the pre-split `index.json` / `ideas.json`, so a repo whose cron has not run yet keeps working.
- Taught the GAS proxy that the web article DB may live behind a different Notion integration. `WEB_NOTION_TOKEN` (falling back to `NOTION_TOKEN`) is now chosen per request, and every page-scoped read/write carries the item's `source`. `src/lib/gas.js` remembers the source of each page ID from the loaded list, so no call site had to change.
- Added a single 404 retry with the other token for page operations. The source comes from a list that can be stale, and without the retry an item whose DB moved would fail with `object_not_found` and no way to recover from the UI.
- `mergeTag` walks both databases with its own token per database, so a tag rename no longer silently skips the web side.
- `web_extract.py` now marks a page 未取得 when no body could be extracted. The default run targets 空欄/再取得, so a failed page drops out of the next pass instead of being retried on every cron tick.

## 1.6.0 - 2026-09-10

### Title

Serve the list from a static JSON; add deletion; move prompts into setting.json

### Changes

- Stopped querying Notion through GAS on every page load. `src/lib/store.js` reads `data/clipstock/index.json` and `ideas.json` — written by a cron job on the Mac — and only falls back to the old GAS path when the JSON cannot be read, so an unconfigured or offline setup still works exactly as before. Thumbnails are untouched: they were always plain image URLs and still load from source.
- Left the detail screen on Notion. The list is the part that scales with the library size; the per-tab body is one page fetch and has to be fresh right after generating, so caching it into the JSON would trade the wrong thing.
- Added `mac/scripts/video/build_clipstock_json.py`, which mirrors the shapes returned by `listVideos_`/`listIdeas_` so the two sources stay interchangeable. It writes through a temp file and renames, so a page load landing mid-write cannot read a truncated JSON.
- Added a delete action (`deleteVideo`) that archives the Notion page, alongside the existing 除外 which only flips the status. 除外 hides a video while keeping the page; delete removes it. Conflating the two would have meant either no way to hide, or no way to actually remove.
- Split generation from 3 stages into 5, one per tab (サマリ・タグ / マインドマップ / 分野別 / 応用 / 活用). "Regenerate this item" previously redid its neighbours — the mindmap tab redid the summary, the apply tab redid the ideas — because they shared a call.
- Moved the five system prompts out of `generate.js` into `setting.json`, editable from the settings modal and overridable per device in localStorage. The code now only supplies the parts that must vary at runtime (`{{TAG_RULE}}`, `{{QUOTE_RULE}}` and friends), which is why those placeholders have to survive editing.

### Affected Files

- `beta/clipstock/setting.json` (new)
- `beta/clipstock/src/lib/store.js` (new)
- `beta/clipstock/src/lib/prompts.js` (new)
- `beta/clipstock/src/lib/generate.js`

- `beta/clipstock/SETUP.md`
- `mac/scripts/video/build_clipstock_json.py` (new)
- `mac/scripts/push/git_push_config.json`

### Notes

- The list is now as stale as the last cron run. That is the cost of the speed-up; the top bar shows the JSON's timestamp so the staleness is visible rather than silent.
- Five stages means five API calls per video instead of three. On a rate-limited free key a bulk run takes longer and burns more of the daily quota.
- `--out` on the Python script and `source_folder` for `clipstock-data` in `git_push_config.json` must point at the same folder. If they diverge, a stale JSON keeps being published with nothing to indicate it.

## 1.5.0 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Wire up playback links on mindmap branches

### Changes

- The mindmap-branch-to-playback-link plumbing existed since 1.3.0 (`linkTimecodes` in `mindmap.js`), but nothing ever populated it: the core stage generated mindmap as a single free-form Markdown string with no quote/timecode mechanism, so branches never carried `[mm:ss]` and the links never appeared.
- Changed the core-stage prompt to return mindmap as structured JSON (`{ title, branches: [{ label, quote, children }] }`) instead of a raw Markdown string, mirroring the fields-stage pattern: the model supplies a verbatim quote per node, this app resolves it against the timestamped transcript via `resolveQuote`, and only matched nodes get a time.
- Added `mindmapToText`, which builds the Markdown itself (heading marks, indentation, timecodes) rather than trusting the model to format it — removing a source of markmap parse failures as a side effect.
- Skipped quotes for transcripts without timestamps, same as fields, so older material renders exactly as before with no time.
- Left the legacy value formats (older plain-markdown mindmaps, and HTML embedded by the previous skill) untouched and still rendering; only newly generated mindmaps use the structured path.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/generate.js`

### Notes

- Regenerating the mindmap (via "この項目を作り直す" or "すべて生成") is required for existing videos to get clickable branches; nothing changes for content that isn't regenerated.
- A branch with no matching quote (a synthesized grouping label, or a fabricated quote) simply carries no time — same "absence is meaningful" rule as fields.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Handle 429 quota errors instead of failing every request

### Changes

- Distinguished the two shapes of a Gemini 429: a per-minute rate limit (temporary, clears in seconds) and a daily/plan quota exhaustion (does not clear until the quota resets), by inspecting the error body rather than treating all 429s the same.
- Added retry with exponential backoff (15s, 30s, 60s, 120s) for the rate-limit case, surfaced as a visible "waiting Ns, retry X/4" message rather than a silent hang.
- Failed fast with a clear message for the daily-quota case instead of burning through retries that cannot succeed.
- Stopped a bulk run immediately when the daily quota is hit, rather than letting it fail through every remaining item, and reported how many videos were completed before the stop.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/generate.js`
- `videos/src/main.js`

### Notes

- Detection is string-based on the error body ("quota" vs "per minute"/"RPM"), since the API does not expose a structured error subtype through the OpenAI-compatible endpoint used here.
- This does not remove the underlying limit — a free-tier key is still capped at roughly 15 requests/minute and 1,500/day as of this writing. It only stops the app from wasting requests against a limit that will not clear.

## 1.4.0 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Add markers; widen bulk generation to partially generated videos

### Changes

- Brought `markers.js` over from `minutes` unchanged and added `src/lib/marker-target.js` to address a single item inside the section storage format (`## heading` / body / `- point`), rebuilding and saving the whole field after each edit.
- Made summary text, section bodies and section points markable in three colours, with an eraser, using the same floating toolbar as `minutes`.
- Excluded headings from marking: they sit next to the trailing timecode and are rarely worth highlighting, so the risk outweighs the benefit.
- Stripped the trailing timecode before marking a point and reattached it on write-back, so a marker cannot swallow or corrupt the timecode.
- Routed marker text through `plainTextOf` everywhere raw tags would otherwise leak: library cards, idea feed, search matching, chat context and generation context.
- Made the manual editor show plain text and carry markers back with `reconcileMarkers`, so highlights survive rewording where the wording is unchanged and drop where it is not.
- Saved markers via `saveField`, which leaves 要約日時, 要約モデル and 状態 untouched — highlighting is not regeneration.
- Widened bulk generation to also offer videos whose 状態 is 要約済み but which are missing one of mindmap/fields/apply/ideas, so a video that lost a single stage to an error is no longer stranded.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/markers.js` (new, copied from `minutes`)
- `videos/src/lib/marker-target.js` (new)
- `videos/src/ui/render.js`
- `videos/src/main.js`
- `videos/src/lib/filters.js`
- `videos/css/styles.css`

### Notes

- Markers are stored inline in the existing text properties; no new Notion column is required.
- The transcript tab is not markable. It lives in the page body rather than a property, so marking it would need block-level writes.
- Regenerating a field discards its markers, since the text they were anchored to no longer exists.

## 1.3.1 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Fix markmap failing to initialise: wrong CDN filename for markmap-lib

### Changes

- Stopped hardcoding browser bundle filenames. `markmap-view` ships `dist/browser/index.js` but `markmap-lib` ships `dist/browser/index.iife.js`; the previous code used `index.js` for both, so `Transformer` never appeared on `window.markmap` and initialisation failed. Requesting the bare package path lets the CDN resolve the entry from the package's own `jsdelivr` field.
- Verified each dependency immediately after loading it, so the error names the specific package and URL that failed instead of reporting a generic initialisation failure.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/mindmap.js`

### Notes

- The raw-markdown fallback behaved as intended during the failure — the content stayed readable.
- Versions remain pinned to `@0.18`; only the filename was at fault.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Jump to the moment in the video: timecodes resolved from verbatim quotes

### Changes

- Added `src/lib/timecode.js`: parsing and formatting of `[mm:ss]` / `[h:mm:ss]`, transcript segmentation, `youtubeUrlAt`, and `resolveQuote`.
- Changed the fields stage to ask the model for the verbatim quote behind each point rather than for a time. Times are then resolved by matching that quote against the timestamped transcript, so a fabricated time cannot reach the UI — an unmatched quote simply yields no link.
- Quote matching normalises width, case and punctuation, and retries with progressively shorter prefixes, since models tend to paraphrase the tail of a quote.
- Rendered resolved times as playback links on section headings and points, in the transcript tab, in mindmap branches (via markdown links markmap makes clickable), and in chat answers.
- Asked the per-video chat to cite `[mm:ss]` from the transcript, but only when the transcript actually carries timestamps.
- Skipped the quote request entirely for transcripts without timestamps, so older material costs nothing extra and still renders.
- Added `docs/process_videos_patch.md` with the Python change: group segments into roughly 30-second lines prefixed with `[mm:ss]`.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/timecode.js` (new)
- `videos/docs/process_videos_patch.md` (new)
- `videos/src/lib/generate.js`
- `videos/src/lib/mindmap.js`
- `videos/src/lib/chat.js`
- `videos/src/ui/render.js`
- `videos/src/main.js`
- `videos/css/styles.css`
- `videos/preview.html`

### Notes

- Requires the Python change to take effect; existing videos need 状態 set back to 新規 to be re-transcribed.
- Times are only attached to 分野別要約. 応用 and 活用アイデア are generated from the summary rather than the transcript, so there is no quote to anchor them to.
- The absence of a link is meaningful: it means the claim could not be located in the transcript.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Add a vocabulary panel: tag frequency, long tail, and merge candidates

### Changes

- Added `src/lib/vocab.js` with `tagStats`, `vocabSummary` and `mergeCandidates`, computed entirely from the already-loaded list — no extra API call and no LLM, so the same data always produces the same suggestions.
- Added a vocabulary panel (topbar, next to settings) showing tag usage as bars, with tags used twice or fewer separated below a dashed line as the cleanup queue.
- Surfaced merge candidates from co-occurrence: a less-used tag that almost always appears alongside a more-used one is likely a rephrasing rather than a separate angle. Each candidate carries a "merge" and a "keep separate" action.
- Kept only the strongest target per source tag, since a tag used once co-occurs 100% with every other tag on that video and would otherwise flood the list.
- Labelled single-use candidates as weak evidence rather than hiding them, since spelling and translation variants surface exactly there.
- Added a `mergeTag` GAS action that rewrites the tag across every matching page server-side, re-reading current tags so a stale client list cannot clobber them. It re-queries from the start each round rather than paging with a cursor, because rewritten pages drop out of the filter and would cause a cursor to skip rows.
- Stored "keep separate" decisions in localStorage rather than adding a Notion column, with a control to clear them.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/vocab.js` (new)
- `videos/src/ui/vocab.js` (new)
- `videos/src/lib/gas.js`
- `videos/src/main.js`
- `videos/index.html`
- `videos/css/styles.css`
- `videos/gas/Code.gs`

### Notes

- Merging is not reversible from the app; the confirmation says so.
- New-tag rate over time is deliberately not included — it needs a running log that does not exist yet.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-03

### Title

Constrain tag generation to the existing vocabulary

### Changes

- Passed the existing tag vocabulary (top 60 by usage) into the first generation stage, instructing the model to pick from it and to coin at most one new tag per video.
- Added `src/lib/tags.js` with `reconcileTags`, which maps returned tags back onto existing spellings using an NFKC + case + separator-insensitive key, so full-width/half-width and casing variants collapse deterministically rather than relying on the prompt.
- Dropped tags that are sentences (containing punctuation) or longer than 20 characters.
- Kept the vocabulary growing within a bulk run, so later videos in the same run see tags coined by earlier ones.
- Left the vocabulary unconstrained when it is empty, so the first videos can establish a base set.
- Added a dismissible notice when a new tag is coined, reusing the bulk progress bar slot.

### Affected Files

- `videos/src/lib/tags.js` (new)
- `videos/src/lib/generate.js`
- `videos/src/main.js`

### Notes

- Reconciliation only merges spelling variants of the same word. Words that are merely close in meaning (生成AI and LLM, Notion and ノーション) are left alone — merging those is a judgement call for a person, not a string comparison.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-02

### Title

Initial release of `videos`: video knowledge library built on the `minutes` architecture

### Changes

- Added a new app `videos` targeting the Notion 動画 database, reusing the browser → GAS → Notion structure of `minutes`.
- Replaced the static `index.json` dependency with a `listVideos` GAS action that queries the Notion database directly, so the list no longer needs a batch-generated intermediate file.
- Added a `listIdeas` GAS action returning only 応用/活用アイデア, keeping the main list payload small.
- Lifted the 2000-character property cap by chunking `rich_text` into multiple objects (up to 100 × 2000) in `richTextProp_`.
- Stored 分野別要約 / 応用 / 活用アイデア in a human-readable `## heading` + `- bullet` format instead of JSON, so the values remain useful when read directly in Notion.
- Stored マインドマップ as markmap Markdown rather than embedded HTML, with detection and iframe fallback for pages written by the previous skill.
- Split AI generation into three stages (core / fields / apply), persisting after each stage so a failure does not discard earlier results, and enabling per-section regeneration.
- Reused the shared `gemma-chat.settings` localStorage key for AI connections, so connections added in `minutes` or `gemma-chat` are available here.
- Added a thumbnail grid library view with per-video generation progress dots and an unread marker.
- Added an idea feed view that flattens 応用/活用アイデア across the whole library, with a shuffle mode for resurfacing older material.
- Added per-video chat (raw transcript or summary as context) and cross-video chat spaces limited to 20 targets.
- Added bulk generation over items whose 状態 is 完了, with progress and cancel.
- Added manual editing, tag editing, title editing, re-transcribe (状態 → 新規) and logical exclusion (状態 → 除外).

### Notes

- Requires new Notion columns: 分野別要約 / 応用 / 活用アイデア / メモ / 要約モデル / 要約日時 / 原文文字数. See `docs/SETUP.md`.
- The Python cron script (`process_videos.py`) is unchanged; it still owns everything up to 状態 = 完了.
- `llm-client.js`, `llm-settings.js` and `markdown.js` are byte-identical copies of the `minutes` versions. Keep them in sync when either side changes.
